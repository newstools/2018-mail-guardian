The Reading List What a Time to Be Alone by Chidera Eggerue: A few weeks ago a friend and I talked about being alone versus being lonely. We swapped hilariously sad stories about the lengths we had gone to, to shake the alone feeling we had mistaken for loneliness.
As the conversation drew to a close, she remembered a book a friend had told her about, What a Time to Be Alone. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>Before she could tell me what was in it, the title won me over because I’m fascinated by my feeling alone when I’m constantly surrounded by loved ones. Unfortunately the book did not live up to my expectations: it’s a self-help book with not that many wise words. But I won’t let this stop the hunt for literary catharsis of some sorts. (ZH) The Playlist Drogas Wave by Lupe Fiasco: This is intelligent music, the kind that shocks you into submission early on, in the first bass strums of a Spanish guitar in the Spanish song Drogas.  Some of the songs were easy on the ear and consistent with Lupe’s hip-hoppy-cum-R&B sound. I don’t know about the Troi Irons feature that comes out of a Goth pop corner reminiscent of Evanescence. I’m still listening, though.
