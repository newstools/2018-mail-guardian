The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has condemned employers in the bus sector for causing a breakdown in negotiations. Unions and employer associations met at the bargaining table at on Thursday as the nationwide bus strike entered its second day. The talks were set down for two days, according to a letter the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) sent to unions, which was seen by News24. In a statement issued by Numsa General Secretary Irvin Jim, the union said that the sector “insulted workers and commuters” by refusing to engage meaningfully during the conciliation, causing talks to break down.

The condition for accepting this proposal was that unions drop all other core demands. Unions are demanding a one-year 12% across the board wage increase, which includes a minimum wage of R8 000. They also want full-pay for dual drivers, compensation for sleeping-out, and for any work between the hours of 8pm and 3am to be deemed the night shift. Citing the sector’s refusal to meaningfully engage with the demands of the five participating unions, encompassing 67 different bus companies, Numsa has called for strike action to escalate. “Our backs are against the wall. We are left with absolutely no option but to intensify the strike,” said Jim.
