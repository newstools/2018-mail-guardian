Crime prevention measures will be taken at hostels throughout the Umlazi area after a 28-year-old man was murdered at the notoriously dangerous Glebelands hostel on Sunday morning. Lwando Gladine, who lived in Block 53, was stabbed to death at the hostel’s Block 55 at three in the morning when he was returning home from Chief’s Tavern. His death is fifth fatal stabbing at the hostel this year. His death comes after five men, who were accused of several murders at the hostile, applied for bail. According to Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, there were multiple stabbing incidents at Umlazi hostels over the weekend.
Although there is currently no suspected motive or suspect, SAPS believes that “there was an element of arguments” and alcohol which are being viewed as factors in the murder. The station commander in Umlazi has promised to “step up crime prevention operations” by specifically increasing surveillance of “legal as well as illegal liquor outlets in and around these hostels”, said Zwane. Vanessa Burger, an Independent Community Activist for Human Rights and Social Justice said in a statement to News24 that the police response to the latest Glebelands murder has been “excellent so far”. “Detectives from the Provincial Organised Crime Task Team investigating Glebelands murders visited the community yesterday and reassured family members that arrests are imminent,” said Burger. Since 2014, there have been 107 murders at the Glebelands hostel and it has been under scrutiny for alleged politically motivated deaths. In an interview with GroundUp, a SAPS investigator explained that people are refusing to give testimony for murders because, “People are afraid, they know that they could be eliminated.”
