Court proceedings in the murder trial of Sandile Mantsoe have been postponed until April 25. Mantsoe is accused of killing his former girlfriend Karabo Mokoena.
He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The postponement was granted after the prosecution asked to present photographic instead of lengthy video evidence to quicken the pace of the trial. Without the video, four witnesses will not be called to the stand. The video evidence, which is from surveillance tapes, depicts Mokoena and Mantsoe in the Sandton Skye Apartments on the night Mokoena disappeared. Mantsoe’s defence team has agreed to allow the prosecution to submit a photo album as evidence. Judge Johnson adjourned the court after the photo evidence was submitted. On Wednesday, three state witnesses will be called to the stand. ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
