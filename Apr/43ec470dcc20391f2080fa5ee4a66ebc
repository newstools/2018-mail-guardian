KPMG has been struck by three scandals over the past year that have dealt serious blows to its reputation.

Its chief executive, Trevor Hoole, resigned, followed by Mike Oddy, its head of audit and a board member. Other resignations include head of tax and board member Muhammad Saloojee, former forensics head and board member Herman de Beer, head of deal advisory John Geel, and Mickey Bove, risk management partner for deal advisory. Now KPMG is again embroiled in a scandal that has seen the government cancelling its contracts with the firm over its audit conduct regarding its client, VBS Mutual Bank, which was placed under curatorship last month. Once again, two senior partners were forced to resign last week.
