Struggle veteran Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has died at the age of 81, her family confirmed in a statement on Monday. Archbishop Emeritus Tutu has issued a statement saying, “May Mam’ uWinnie rest in peace and rise in glory.” Tutu said Madikizela-Mandela refused to be bowed by the imprisonment of her husband, the perpetual harassment of her family by security forces, detentions, bannings and banishment. He and his wife Leah have sent their condolences to her daughters, grandchildren and extended family saying her courageous defiance was deeply inspirational to Tutu and generations of activists.
