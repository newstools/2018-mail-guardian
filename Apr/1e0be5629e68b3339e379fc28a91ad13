For her neighbours and her comrades, Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was both an adviser and friend. Unlike many of her fellow comrades, Mam’ Winnie remained in Soweto. “She did not move to Sandton or Fourways,” said Themba Khumalo. Khumalo is the conveyor of sub district four and he says he will remember Mama Winnie for her work as a counsellor and adviser. “She was our Parliament,” Khumalo said. “She never moved from Soweto.
When we had no food or water, she gave us.” ANC Johannesburg representative Nonceba Molwele said Madikizela-Mandela has grieved her “She is a living history, we are learning lessons from her everyday.” Thandi Moraka, deputy Secretary General of the ANC Youth League said the country is still divided along racial and gender lines. “Mama Winnie wanted a non-racial country.”
