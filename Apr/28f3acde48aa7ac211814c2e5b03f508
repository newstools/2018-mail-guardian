Representatives of the family of Winnie Madikizela Mandela have announced a route for the procession following her casket to her home on the afternoon of Friday 12 April. A guard of honour will line the streets from 2PM tomorrow when the casket departs Kupane Funeral Parlour. The procession will move along Sofasonke Street, and then, at the first big circle, turn right around the circle to continue down Sofasonke Street. It will continue straight down and cross over the bridge and Klipspruit Road until the road becomes Khumalo Street. The procession will then turn left into Mtipa Street, then left again into Maseli Street towards the Mandela Residence. Vehicles will stop at the bottom of Maseli Street, where men from the Mandela family will conduct traditional rituals before offloading the casket from vehicle. The casket will be carried by the male grandchildren followed by the men from the Mandela and Madikizela family.
It will be carried from the bottom of the road slowly proceeding up into the family home. The family urges those wishing to salute Mrs Madikizela-Mandela to position themselves along this route as it will not be possible for people to enter the family home because of the number of people expected. The Madikizela-Mandela family are deeply grateful for the outpouring of love and support since they announced the death of their mother.
