Kagiso Rabada, 22,  has been unveiled as the latest sports personality to promote high-profile brand Tag Heuer. The deal is a major achievement for the fast bowler as the brand is known for procuring only the elite of the sporting and arts world to don the time pieces in their promotions. Tag Heuer is a luxury Swiss watch manufacturer – think R10 000 a piece for their cheaper range.
Current brand ambassadors include Avenger Chris Hemsworth, five-time Superbowl-winning quarterback Tom Brady, supermodel Bella Hadid and Japanese footballer Shinji Kagawa.

This is a great recognition,” Rabada told the Mail & Guardian through his agent when asked how it feels to be among an exclusive group of athletes who have been paid to wear the luxury watches. “TAG Heuer are represented by some of the world’s greatest athletes, many of whom I am a great admirer of, which leaves me even more thrilled to partner with such an iconic brand.” The deal comes shortly after Rabada’s performance that has been instrumental in taking the Proteas to a first Test victory over Australia since readmission. He also reclaimed his No 1 Test bowler in the world spot. In past TAG Heuer adverts you’ll see titans such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Leonardo DiCaprio, Lewis Hamilton, Tiger Woods and Maria Sharapova. The brand made headlines in 2016 when it dropped the latter, its star ambassador at the time, after the Russian tennis star revealed she had failed a drugs test. The English Premier League, Spanish La Liga and Manchester United also all have partnerships with Tag Heuer.
