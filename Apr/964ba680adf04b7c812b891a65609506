The man who refused the appeal of Solomon Mahlangu’s death sentence has died. Former Democratic Alliance leader Tony Leon said that his father, retired judge Ramon Leon, had died over the weekend. Judge Leon was dubbed a “hanging judge”  and was involved in the legal proceedings that saw both Mahlangu and Andrew Zondo to their deaths.  The death penalty was suspended in 1990, as talks between the then National Party government and the ANC gathered pace. It was formally scrapped in 1994.

Leon allowed his accomplice — who ratted in return for anonymity — go free. Two years later, Leon became a supporter of the Society for the Abolition of the Death Penalty. Mahlangu, meanwhile was sentenced to death in 1979 and his appeal was turned down by Leon. Police accosted Mahlangu, along with Mondy Johannes Motloung and George “Lucky” Mahlangu in Goch Street, Johannesburg, which resulted in a gun fight on June 13 1977. Two civilians were killed and another two were wounded. Although Motloung was the one who was involved in the deaths of the two civilians, Mahlangu was tried using the court rule of common purpose which saw him charged with two accounts of murder and several charges under the Terrorism Act. Motloung was deemed unfit to try because of brain damage that he sustained during the fight. The Citizen has reported that they came upon the news incidentally. The publication said it had reached out to the family for comments over Sydney Mufamadi’s allegations that Leon junior made former Police Commissioner George Fivaz reopen the investigation into Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s alleged involvement in the murder of Stompie Seipei.
