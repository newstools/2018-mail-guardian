Parliament’s portfolio committee on public enterprises is seeking legal advice from the Speaker in dealing with Dudu Myeni, the Gupta brothers and Duduzani Zuma who have all failed to appear before the inquiry to give evidence. The committee met on Tuesday to discuss steps to be taken against the witnesses. Fin24 previously reported the committee would seek help from the Hawks to track down Ajay, Atul and Rajesh ‘Tony’ Gupta as well as Duduzani Zuma. This after as the Sheriff was unable to deliver summons to them to appear for the inquiry. The summons was delivered to Myeni’s place of residence, but she failed to appear.
