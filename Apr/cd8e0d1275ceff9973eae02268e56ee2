The passing of the ‘mother of the nation’ has given South Africans a chance to start remembering her now, Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini said. Instead of waiting for an anniversary, Dlamini challenged South Africans to start remembering Madikizela-Mandela now and work towards the issues she cared about, namely unity and the emancipation of the poor. Dlamini believes that Madikizela-Mandela would have wanted the VAT increase of 1% reversed. He also believes that she would have wanted the end of Gauteng’s e-tolls. “She stood for what she believed in and she stood firm.” Dlamini said he found out about Mam’ Winnie’s death while spending time with his family in Durban for the Easter weekend. He said he was shocked to hear of her passing because, despite many stints to the hospital, she had survived. In remembering her and her desire for unity, Dlamini hopes that, like Madikizela-Mandela would have wanted, all workers will unite under Cosatu. “Mam’ Winnie’s passing has created an opportunity for different voices and opposing views to speak… Making this possible for South Africans to unite and take on poverty,” said Dlamini.
