The news of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s death broke while I was listening to Nduduzo Makhathini’s Listening to the Ground. The opening track, Same Mother, ends with the refrain “Ngaphandle kwakho Mama, sizoba yini na? Yini na?” As I reflect on Winnie’s life I take into consideration what she means to a number of black people in a South Africa that is unravelling by the second; what she means to me as a young historian whose recent dissertation was on her intellectual contributions; what she means to the 1976 generation of young people; and above all, what she means to her family and her personal assistant (Mam’ Zodwa Zwane who moved mountains to fit me in for an interview with Mama back in 2016). The song’s refrain is painfully apt: What would we have been without you, Ma? What will become of us without you, Ma? Researching this icon’s contributions has not been without difficulties.
