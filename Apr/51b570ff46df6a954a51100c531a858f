The Premier Soccer League’s disciplinary committee has announced Kaizer Chiefs will be fined R250 000 for failing to control their fans earlier this month. R200 000 of which, however, will be suspended for 24 months provided a similar incident does not occur. Ugly scenes emerged from the FNB Stadium on April 7 after the final whistle confirmed Amakhosi’s 3-0 humiliation at the hands of Chippa United.
Players and staff were rushed down the tunnel as supporters threw objects onto the pitch and vandalised the stands.  The result snuffed out what little chance there was at that point of Steve Komphela’s men challenging for the title. “Last night, the Club was found guilty of misconduct in failing to provide adequate security at the game,” the PSL said in a statement. “The Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned Kaizer Chiefs with a fine of R250 000 of which R200 000 was suspended for 24 months on condition they are not found guilty of a similar offence during that period.” Amakhosi have endured a torrid time in recent weeks and fans fear this could be a third successive season with no silverware. The club last week assured its followers that a major overhaul lies in the near future. It’s widely suspected that coach Komphela will not renew his expiring contract. The PSL announcement comes two days after sanctions were levelled against Soweto rival Orlando Pirates. As a result of fan violence at Loftus in February last year, the Buccaneers were ordered to play their next two home games behind closed doors (although one is suspended). BidVest Wits will thus travel to an empty stadium on Wednesday night. The club has said it will refund fans that brought tickets
