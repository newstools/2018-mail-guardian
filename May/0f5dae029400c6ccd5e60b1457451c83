Mugabe is alleged to have assaulted Engels at a Johannesburg hotel where her sons were staying. Engels took to social media to recount how Mugabe had assaulted her with an extension cord, receiving deep lacerations on the back of her head and forehead.

After the incident, Mugabe was granted diplomatic immunity by then-Dirco minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, allowing her to escape charges of assault. Later that August, AfriForum announced it would take on Engels’ case and make a review application to overrule Dirco’s decision. According to News 24, Engels is optimistic about the case. “I know that she will come face the full might of the law … I leave it all in God’s hands to get us through everything.” READ MORE: The madness of Queen Grace
