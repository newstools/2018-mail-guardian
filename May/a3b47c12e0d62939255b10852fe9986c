The
Mail and Guardian’s Pontsho Pilane has scooped the prestigious Discovery Health Journalist of the Year award. Pilane, a member of the
M&G’s multiple award winning health reporting team, Bhekisisa, also won the upcoming journalist of the year award and the nation builder award at the event held at the Discovery head office in Sandton on Thursday. “I am in disbelief. I have only been a health journalist for 18 months and to receive the greatest affirmation in my field so early in my career has inspired me to keep going.
Winning the award is a testament to the fact that thorough, well-prepared and evidence-based journalism is well worth the effort. I am so thankful to the Bhekisisa team for forging the way for powerful health journalism in South Africa,” Pilane said. The journalism that won her the nod was “Free to Bleed”, that lay bare the daily struggle countless young women face across South Africa to get access to sanitary pads. The other was “ABC’s of Autism”, offering an intimate look inside the world of autistic children. Khadija Patel, editor-in-chief of the M&G said the three awards were testimony to Pilane’s talent, hard work and dedication. “These awards are so richly deserved,” she said.
