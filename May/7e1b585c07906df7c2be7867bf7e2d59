Technically, it would be possible to attend each of the festivals over the April to June period in the southeastern nook of Africa. The most practical way to go about it would be to stay in Maputo for the Azgo festival, spend Friday in Johannesburg for Bassline Africa Day, Saturday in Durban for Zakifo and Sunday in the Malkerns Valley for Bushfire. Top the experience off with a weekend on Réunion Island for Sakifo and you would have attended the festivals that make up the Igoda festival circuit.
