READ MORE: NGO’s sexual harassment woes grow In a statement released by Equal Education’s Interim National Coordinator Leanne Jansen-Thomas and Deputy General Secretary Ntuthuzo Ndzomo on Friday night, they said the organisation was “deeply distressed by the allegations of sexual harassment levelled against the former Treasurer”. “In the past month, Doron, former General Secretary Tshepo Motsepe, and former Head of National Organising Luyolo Mazwembe, have resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment. This has been an incredibly difficult period for Equal Education.
We know that the trust and confidence which our supporters have placed in us, and the reputation which we have built over 10 years of struggle, has been damaged by what has transpired. However, we are committed to confronting these difficult times in our movement’s history, with honesty and with integrity,” the organisation said.

The harassment was allegedly covered up by other leading activists, including Zackie Achmat, and an organisational culture of intimidation that prevented women from speaking out. Isaacs and Achmat deny all allegations against them. On Thursday night, Equal Education’s management also wrote to the National Council requesting the suspension and investigation of Isaacs.
