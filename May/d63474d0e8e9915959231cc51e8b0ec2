Football legends, players and officials have poured into the Sandton Convention Centre to learn who made the cut for the 2017/18 PSL awards. Champions Sundowns and their star Percy Tau are expected to dominate the awards but as always we can look forward to a few surprises this evening. The forward is the favourite to clinch the player of the year award for a 11-goal season that guided Sundowns to the league title and has seen him persistently linked with a big-money move to Europe.
Teammate Hlompho Kekana and Maritzburg United’s Siphesihle Ndlovu will challenge Tau for the honour of being called the footballer of the season – chosen by the PSL’s 16 coaches. Maritzburg United coach Fadlu Davids has the best chance of preventing Sundowns’ Pitso Mosimane from grabbing the coach of the season. Davids’ transformation of Maritzburg has been widely hailed as he guided them to fourth place and the Nedbank Cup final. Milutin Sredojević, meanwhile, was recognised for his equally remarkable improvement of Orlando Pirates from shambles to title contenders. You can watch the awards live on SuperSport and SABC 1. Below is the full list of nominations.
