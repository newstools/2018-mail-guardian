Siya Kolisi has been named as Springbok captain for the upcoming three-Test series against England. The national team’s Twitter account made the announcement on Monday morning, also revealing that Pieter-Steph du Toit will captain the side against Wales in Washington on Saturday. Both players will take the leadership reins for the first time.
Kolisi will become the first black skipper in the team’s history. The Stormers flanker was among the favourites to assume the role in the absence of Warren Whiteley and Eben Etzebeth. “I believe both of them will do a good job as captains,” coach Rassie Erasmus said on the announcement. “My philosophy is that each player must take responsibility for his position and must therefore work extremely hard with that one goal in mind – to make the Springboks successful again.” The 26-year-old has lead the Stormers since the beginning of the 2017 Super Rugby season and has been a regular for the Springboks since making his debut in 2013. The loose-forward has four tries to his name in 28 international Test caps. His Stormers teammate, Du Toit, has made 32 appearances for the national side.
