Abducted South African photojournalist Shiraaz Mohamed is believed to be alive because of the response his family, and humanitarian group Gift of the Givers, received to a list of questions they had drafted when an anonymous caller said he could communicate with Mohamed.  It was those 10 questions that helped determine almost a year after Mohamed was kidnapped in Syria that he is still alive, the family said.
Gift of the Givers made the announcement on Tuesday, after the family confirmed that it was only Mohamed who could have answered the questions.  According to Gift of the Givers, the anonymous caller told them that Mohamed had a message of his own to give when he received the questions: “salaams (greetings) for his mother and family and to Gift of the Givers, he is very happy with the questions and wants to be released asap”.
