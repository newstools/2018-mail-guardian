Suspended chief financial officer (CFO) Anoj Singh resigned on Monday evening. He is now appearing before the Eskom inquiry to answer to allegations that he was involved in Gupta-linked tender irregularities. Singh allegedly received a R400-million secret payment in an obscure offshore entity. He was meant to appear before the Eskom inquiry in December, but his appearance before the parliamentary inquiry was postponed because Singh submitted a 400 page dossier at 23:00, the night before he was meant to appear.
The committee’s chair, Daphne Rantho, had accused Singh of trying to undermine parliament.ADVERTISINGinRead invented by Teads
