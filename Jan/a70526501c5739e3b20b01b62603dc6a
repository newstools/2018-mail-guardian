The 75th Golden Globes is the first major Hollywood award ceremony since the film industry witnessed as many testimonies of sexual harassment. In his opening speech, first time host of the awards, Seth Meyers ended his speech by paying tribute to all the women present.  “People in this room worked really hard to get here, but it’s clear more now than ever before that the women had to work even harder,” he said. When collecting the honorary Cecil B DeMille lifetime achievement award, Oprah Winfrey’s speech recapitulated the award’s mood.  The red carpet at the 75th Golden Globes was dominated by stars dressed in all black, in support of the Time’s Up movements,  to honour survivors and victims of sexual assaults.
