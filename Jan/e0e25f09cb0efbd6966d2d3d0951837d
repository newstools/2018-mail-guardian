A crash between two Metrorail trains at the Geldenhuys train station in Germiston has left over 200 commuters moderately injured on Tuesday morning. The incident occurred after an incoming train crashed into a stationary train from behind. Both trains had passengers on board and were headed for Springs in the east of Gauteng. Prasa spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng said: “One of the trains was authorised to be stationary there and it was waiting for a manual signal for it to leave the station.” Mofokeng further went on to explain that the train station had experienced cable theft which is why a manual system was being used. Paramedics arrived on the scene to find that one of the carriages had derailed, but had not overturned. “Once the patients have been treated, they will be transported to various hospitals in the area for further treatment,” said ER24 spokesperson Russell Meiring. “The exact details surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities are on the scene and will be launching an investigation into the matter.”  Commuters using trains running between Germiston and Johannesburg were told to expect delays of up to 60 minutes. The Kroonstad Crash This is the second train crash in a week, the first was a deadly one in Kroonstad on Thursday that saw 19 people lose their lives when a Klerksdorp truck driver misjudged the Shosholoza Meyl train’s speed when it attempted to cross the railway near the Geneva station. One-hundred-and-sixty-four people were injured in the crash.
DNA tests are still underway to identify some of the bodies.
