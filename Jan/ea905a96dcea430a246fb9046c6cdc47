Last year, when the Mail & Guardian was reporting on what appeared to be a declaration of war on the Trillian whistle-blower by her former employers, a missive from a legal representative of Trillian arrived at our offices. It intimated that our interest in the financial advisory firm and its amazing dealings with Eskom and our coverage of the whistle-blower’s claims were somehow coloured by ulterior motives, personal agendas and undeclared conflicts of interest. We dismissed the letter with the contempt it deserved and directed the Trillian representatives to the Press Council. This played out just before the revelations in the tranche of emails secured by the Sunday Times, City Press and Daily Maverick.
