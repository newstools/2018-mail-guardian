The man who shot and killed his teenage son will appear in the Pretoria magistrate’s court on Thursday. The 50-year-old was arrested on Wednesday morning following the shooting of Luyanda Themba Tshabalala outside of Fred Norman Secondary school in Ennerdale. According to earlier police reports, the man had dropped his son off for night classes at the school.
As he waited for his son, he fell asleep and was awakened by the sound of knocking coming from the passenger window. Believing he was being hijacked, he pulled out his firearm and shot in the direction of the knocking, killing the teenager. Tshabalala’s stepmother Sibongile told media sources that her husband discharged his firearm in self-defence. She also revealed that Luyanda had called his father three times before he was shot and killed.
