Ashwin Willemse reportedly did not see the value in participating in SuperSport’s independent review. On Tuesday, SuperSport delivered the conclusion on an independent review on the Ashwin Willemse on-air walk-out. The report claims the conduct of Nick Mallett and Naas Botha “does not manifest naked racism and was not motivated by racist considerations”. During the review, it was remarked that Willemse had opted out of the review process, conducted by by Advocate Vincent Maleka with the assistance of Professor Adam Habib. Willemse’s lawyer Nqobizitha Mlilo told SAFM radio host Tsepiso Makwetla on Wednesday morning that Willemse “did not see any value in participating with the process” because the rugby analyst had already expressed his views before the independent review. Mlilo said that the rugby analyst and former Springbok wing is intending to fulfil his contract with SuperSport. Willemse walked off of the SuperSport set last month after he accused co-hosts Mallett and Botha of patronising him.
SuperSport initially denied that there was significant animosity between them, but announced that all three would be pulled off the air while an independent mediator looked into the issue.
