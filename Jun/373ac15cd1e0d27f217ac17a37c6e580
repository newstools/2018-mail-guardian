The New Development Bank (NDB), the financing arm of the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) bloc, is ready to provide $8-billion for infrastructure in South Africa — but critics say the bank has so far failed key tests, especially that of transparency. There are also concerns that most of the loans to date have been dollar denominated, exposing the borrower to currency risk. They also do not appear to have been concessional, and there are fears that not enough due diligence was done in granting a recent loan to Transnet. The vice-president of the NDB, Leslie Maasdorp, told the Mail & Guardian at the bank’s recent annual meeting in Shanghai that the $8-billion will be allocated to fund South Africa’s infrastructure gap. The NDB, led by new board chairperson Nhlanhla Nene, has announced total funding of $5-billion for projects in Brics countries.
