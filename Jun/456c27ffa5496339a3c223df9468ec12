In this episode we meet Anthero Bowie, a former gang member who is out of prison and trying to reinvent himself as a poet. But is it possible for Bowie to reinvent himself? The entire episode plays out in his neighbourhood — Belhar Extension 13 in Cape Flats — which produces young men like Anthero everyday, and now refuses to see him in a new light.
