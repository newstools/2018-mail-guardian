The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants’ (SAICA) Board has accepted KPMG’s offer to resign as SAICA’s external auditors. SAICA said in a statement KPMG cited possible perceived independence concerns if they were to perform the 2018 audit as a result of the current SAICA-appointed Ntsebeza Inquiry. The inquiry is looking into some of the former and current KPMG-employed Chartered Accountants and will be concluding shortly. “All the parties believe this is in the best interests of SAICA, its members and KPMG.” READ MORE: Battered KPMG stays afloat SAICA said it will now begin a tender process to appoint external auditors and its Board will table a progress report to its members at the Annual General Meeting on 26 June 2018. Following the completion of the tender process, a Special General Meeting will be called to approve the appointment of the recommended audit firm, SAICA said. The Ntsebeza inquiry, led by Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza was established to investigate the conduct of SAICA’s employed by KPMG from January 2013 onward to determine if they acted in contravention to the SAICA code of Code of Professional Conduct, Fin24 previously reported. The inquiry panel also includes Advocate Vuyani Ngalwana SC, Dr. Claudelle von Eck, Freeman Nomvalo and Malcolm Robert Johnston. The inquiry was meant to conclude in April 2018, but Ntsebeza said the report would be released at the end of June.
