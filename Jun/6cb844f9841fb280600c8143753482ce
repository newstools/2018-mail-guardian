SuperSport on Tuesday published the outcome of the independent review into the May 19 on-air incident involving Ashwin Willemse, Nick Mallett and Naas Botha. SuperSport appointed Advocate Vincent Maleka SC, a respected, independent professional, to review the allegations fully and objectively, after initial attempts to resolve the issue amicably and expeditiously by way of discussions with the presenters involved, did not resolve the issue. Advocate Maleka SC conducted an extensive process and produced a comprehensive 50-page report. Advocate Maleka SC attended to the following in compiling his report: Ashwin regrettably decided not to participate in the review, despite the fact that all parties involved were advised of this process before it started and raised no objections at that time. Advocate Maleka SC found the following: Advocate Maleka SC made a number of recommendations, all of which will be implemented by SuperSport: Given the content of the report, it is expected that Naas and Nick will resume studio duties in the future, at a time to be determined by SuperSport. While SuperSport is disappointed that Ashwin did not participate in Advocate Maleka’s review, it respects his right not to do so. “In the spirit of reconciliation, I will make another attempt to reach out to Ashwin for us to find a mutually-acceptable way forward so that he knows that this issue has been fairly investigated. Notwithstanding what has happened, one cannot forget that Ashwin reached the peak of international sport while facing very difficult circumstances and he continues to inspire many young people in our country. He represents the aspirations of many and I sincerely hope that Ashwin will respond positively” concluded Gideon Khobane, CEO of SuperSport. — Sport24
