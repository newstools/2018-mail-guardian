The Springboks remain seventh on the official World Rugby rankings despite their 42-39 win over England in Johannesburg at the weekend. The Boks picked up just over one rating point but stay behind Scotland in the rankings - the Scots having beaten Canada 48-10 in Edmonton at the weekend. England, meanwhile, slipped to fourth spot for the first time in two years. They are replaced by Australia, who beat Ireland 18-9 in Brisbane. In ending Ireland’s 12-match winning run, the Wallabies picked up 1.07 points - enough to knock England off third spot. For now, the Irish are safe in second place, behind New Zealand who turned in a second-half masterclass to beat France 52-11, but the difference between the Six Nations champions and the Wallabies is now down to one and a half points. The All Blacks scored 44 unanswered points in the second half in Auckland to start their international season with a bang.
However, the win did not come with any reward from a rankings point of view due to the near 15-point gap between themselves and Les Bleus who threatened to cause an upset when they led 11-8 at half-time. Wales beat Argentina 23-10 in San Juan but remain fifth in the rankings. According to World Rugby’s official website, a win by a greater margin than 13 points would have taken them above England. As it is, they are now just six-hundredths of a point behind their neighbours in fifth. Argentina’s loss of two-thirds of a rating point drops them to 10th, below Fiji. – News24 Top 10 in latest World Rugby standings: 1. New Zealand 93.99 2. Ireland 88.05 3. Australia 86.56 4.
