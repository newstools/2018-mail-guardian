Sibanye-Stillwater has confirmed that another miner has died at its Driefontein operations near Carltonville. “One of our employees entered a gully and they were busy with the night shift cleaning, so basically he was hit by a scraper. He was fatally injured,” spokesperson James Wellsted said on Tuesday morning. Wellsted said the death was still under investigation. The death toll at Sibanye-Stillwater’s operations this year alone stands at over 20, close to half of the fatalities in the entire mining industry.
