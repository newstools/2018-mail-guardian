Ajax Cape Town has confirmed it has opted not to renew its contract with Tendai Ndoro, the Zimbabwean striker who has been at the centre of the club’s ongoing bid for survival. In May the South African Football Association (Safa) ruled that Ajax Cape Town had illegally fielded Ndoro, docking the Mother City team nine points. The ruling saw the club automatically relegated from the lucrative Premier Soccer League.
The footballer himself received a two-match suspension.

Ndoro was accused of violating Fifa regulations by playing for three clubs in one season. Platinum Stars, Polokwane City and SuperSport United protested Ndoro’s eligibility. The PSL charged Ajax with using a player who had already played for two different clubs previously in a single season. The matter over Ndoro’s eligibility went to a Safa arbitration. Ndoro played a game for Orlando Pirates in August‚ then signed for and played for Al Faisaly in Saudi Arabia. He signed for Ajax in late December and has played seven games for them since. The Cape Town side was forced to forfeit three matches and was fined R50 000 for each game. Ndoro reportedly cost the club R2.5-million from Al-Faisaly earlier this year‚ which at the time the club stated was on a two-season contract. He made eight appearances for the Urban Warriors in all competitions‚ scoring just a single goal. Earlier this month the striker spent a weekend behind bars after he was accused of assaulting his wife. According to SowetanLive, the 33-year-old was arrested for allegedly throwing a television at his wife and attempting to strangle her.
