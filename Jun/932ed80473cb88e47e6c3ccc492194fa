Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene has extended South African Revenue Service (Sars) acting commissioner Mark Kingon’s stint at the revenue service by another 90 days. The finance ministry said this extension was implemented through Section 7 of the Sars Act and will be in effect for 90 days as of June 17. “Section 7 of the SARS Act empowers the Minister of Finance to appoint an acting Commissioner.
The President, however, appoints a permanent Commissioner,” the ministry stated. In a statement released on Sunday, the national treasury explained that President Cyril Ramaphosa will be expected to appoint a permanent commissioner. Kingon — who has been with SARS since its establishment in 1997 — was initially appointed as acting commissioner on March 19 following President Cyril Ramaphosa’s suspension of commissioner Tom Moyane. At the time Ramaphosa accused Moyane of overseeing a “deterioration in public confidence in the institution” and letting public finances become compromised under his watch. Last week, Moyane was served a detailed account of the charges against him at his upcoming disciplinary hearing. In a 69-page affidavit, Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan laid out the state’s case against suspended Sars commissioner Tom Moyane. Some of the allegations levelled against Moyane include instructing a SARS employee not to cooperate with the KPMG investigation into the SARS High Risk Unit, making unauthorised bonus payments and misleading parliament.
