At the press screening for the European Film Festival, cocurator Lesedi Moche stated that she was not interested in using the festival as a vehicle to present a staid Europe that was unaffected by patterns of human migration. The two films presented on the night, Rungano Nyoni’s I Am Not a Witch and Andrzej Wajda’s Afterimage, seemed to sketch a broad outline of her words as well as the scope of the festival’s programmatic range. I Am Not a Witch, which picked up the outstanding debut award at this year’s British Academy Film Awards, is set in Zambia and tackles themes of superstition. Polish director Wajda’s swan song tells the story of artist Wladyslaw Strzeminski, a towering figure in Polish art history who was reduced to a pauper by the Stalinist regime.
