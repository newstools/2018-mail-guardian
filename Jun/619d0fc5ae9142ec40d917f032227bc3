National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams has declined to put former president Jacob Zuma’s corruption case on hold. This follows a request by Michael Hulley for a “stay of proceedings” due to a dispute over legal fees. This is according to TimesLive. In a letter in response to Zuma’s legal representative Hulley, which has been seen by TimesLive, Abrahams reportedly states: “I regrettably cannot accede to your request for a ‘stay of proceedings in all criminal and allied matters’.
In the event it is assumed that I should direct that the criminal trial in the Durban High Court be withdrawn‚ I decline to do so.“In my view‚ the court must determine issues relating to the accused’s legal representation and any defence applications in relation thereto.” Zuma will therefore have to persuade the Durban High Court to stay his prosecution — which the state says will be ready to begin in November.
