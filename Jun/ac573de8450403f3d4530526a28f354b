The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was issued a proclamation by then president Jacob Zuma in May 2010 to probe allegations of corruption at the Gauteng department of health. As prescribed by the proclamation, the SIU investigation covered the period January 1 2006 to May 14 2010. The final report detailing the outcomes of the probe was submitted to Zuma in March 2017. However, it was only released over a year later in May 2018 by the Ramaphosa administration following a Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) request by non-governmental organisation SECTION27. The report alleges that during his tenure as Gauteng health MEC from 2006 to 2009, Brian Hlongwa brought the department to its knees with limousine-chauffeured luxury spa treatments, jobs for cash and blatant corruption. The SIU has referred the matter to the South Gauteng Director of Public Prosecution, among other legal bodies, for possible criminal charges to be brought against those involved including the former health MEC.
