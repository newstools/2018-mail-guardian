Gauteng Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is currently visiting the Fred Norman Secondary School in Ennerdale, south of Johannesburg to address pupils after two violent incidences occurred. On Tuesday evening, Lesufi announced on Twitter that a 50-year-old father had allegedly shot and killed his 16-year-old son outside the school at around 9 pm. SAPS spokesperson Mpande Khoza confirmed the shooting to News24, saying the man had dropped off his son for night classes at the school. The father fell asleep while waiting in his car and was startled when his son knocked on the passenger side window. Not realising it was his son, the father allegedly shot the learner with a firearm he had with him.
The boy died on his way to the hospital, said Khoza. The man was arrested on Wednesday morning after giving a police statement on Tuesday night. Lesufi also wrote in a Facebook status that a Grade 12 pupil from the same school was abducted and raped after the shooting.
