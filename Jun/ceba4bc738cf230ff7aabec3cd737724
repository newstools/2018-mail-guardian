Narrative Means: Artistic works begin with an experience or idea that is then translated into a tangible expression by the artist. Each artist featured in the group exhibition Narrative Means grapples with the tension between perception and meaning.
They include artist, architect and filmmaker Alfredo Jaar, photographer David Goldblatt, and artists Ghada Amer, Reza Farkhondeh, Kendell Geers and William Kentridge. The exhibition hopes to facilitate a heightened encounter between the object produced, the hand that made it and the viewer. Through this exchange, a story unfolds and, with it, new meanings are made. Details: The exhibition runs until July 14 at the Goodman Gallery, 163 Jan Smuts Avenue, Parkwood, Johannesburg.
