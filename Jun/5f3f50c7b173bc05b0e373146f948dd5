The Public Servants’ Association (PSA) is planning a national strike at the South African Social Services Agency (Sassa), where the union represents more than half the workers employed at the registration centres and pay points. The strike is planned from June  11 and will take place on days when there are no pay outs, but it will severely affect the registration of new welfare recipients and could halt the agency’s operations. “We are going to organise it so that it doesn’t disrupt the distribution of grants but all other Sassa [operations will be affected],” PSA general manager Ivan Fredericks said this week. The remuneration of Sassa employees is governed by the Sassa Act, which gives the minister of social development the prerogative to decide on increases.
