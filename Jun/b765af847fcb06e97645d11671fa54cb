Western Cape police are on the hunt for the shooters in a taxi war in Cape Town this week that claimed the lives of 13 people and wounded several others, and the provincial government is threatening to shut down the ranks. At stake are the lucrative Delft to Wynberg and Delft to Claremont routes, which pass through Mitchells Plain, Philippi, Nyanga, Khayelitsha and Gugulethu. Police said the shooting started last Friday night in Wynberg, when a man narrowly escaped being killed at the taxi rank. Shortly afterwards, two taxi drivers were shot at the Delft taxi rank, among them the popular taxi boss and chairperson of the Delft Taxi Council, Nazeem Daniels. Another shooting occurred in Khayelitsha, where a taxi driver was killed and a commuter wounded. This article is only available to Mail & Guardian subscribers at present.
