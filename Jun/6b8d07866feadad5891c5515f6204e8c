After just two months since resigning from Kaizer Chiefs in April, Steve Komphela is back in the Absa Premiership as the new Bloemfontein Celtic head coach. The 50-year-old signed a two-year contract with an additional one-year option, the Free State outfit said in a statement released. “Our strategy was to get a reputable local coach with immense pedigree, who can take us to greater heights and in Steve, we found an appropriate candidate,” club chairman Max Tshabalala said. Tshabalala agrees that the new man at the helm will need time to rebuild a strong, competitive and exciting team that will be aligned with the culture of the club. “Last season was complicated and we failed to achieve our goals,” Tshabalala continued. “However, we have now acquired the services of someone passionate, hungry for success and willing to bring the excitement synonymous with Celtic supporters. “He has the judgment, knowledge and experience.
He promotes the youth and has an exceptional eye for raw talent and that is exactly what we need as a team.” The Celtic head-honcho added: “We are relying heavily on the support of our forever supportive fans to rally behind the coach and his team.” The 2018/19 PSL campaign kicks off in August. — Sport24
