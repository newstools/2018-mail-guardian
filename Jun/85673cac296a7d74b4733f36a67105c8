What would European and North American collections look like if institutions, curators and acquisitions committees did not have myopic vision? This year’s Berlin Biennale, titled We Don’t Need Another Hero (referencing Tina Turner’s anthem), gives audiences a glimpse into what that might look like. The biennale’s title reminds us that there is no need for a saviour to “correct” or redirect how we see art, and who we see in art. Artists from the Global South have long been producing aesthetically and technically remarkable and politically astute work; this is just Germany’s chance to host it. Biennale curator Gabi Ngcobo and her co-curators — Yvette Mutumba, Nomaduma Rosa Masilela, Moses Serubiri and Thiago de Paula Souza — stressed that the works in this biennale should not be read solely through the lens of post-coloniality or race and identity politics. This is clearly not a loud Empire Strikes Back kind of exhibition. This article is only available to Mail & Guardian subscribers at present. Please login or consider subscribing.
