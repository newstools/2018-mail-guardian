Kagiso Rabada’s bid to overturn an international Test ban has succeeded. The Proteas fast bowler was suspended after his apparent physical contact against Australian captain Steve Smith in the second Test of the tour at St George’s Park, Port Elizabeth. BREAKING: Rabada cleared to play next #SAvAUS Test! However, he still gets a fine and one demerit point. https://t.co/Doji6J7CFl pic.twitter.com/CLUrqTmcmo — ICC (@ICC) March 20, 2018  “The key issue is whether Mr Rabada made ‘inappropriate and deliberate physical contact’ with Mr Smith,” ruled Michael Heron, who chaired the hearing. “I am not ‘comfortably satisfied’ that Mr Rabada intended to make contact and I therefore find him not guilty of the charge under 2.2.7.” Rabada, however, will still be given a demerit point for his actions and will now be on a tightrope to avoid a future suspension. “I am entitled, however, to consider whether the conduct involved constitutes a lower level offence.
I consider the conduct was inappropriate, lacked respect for his fellow player and involved non-deliberate and minor contact. The actions contravened the principle that a dismissed batsman should be left alone. “I consider a penalty of the imposition of a fine of 25% of the applicable match fee to be the appropriate penalty for the breach of Article 2.1.1. As a consequence, 1 demerit point accrues. Mr. Rabada will be well aware of the consequences of any further breaches of the code.”
