Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba provided feedback on the meeting he attended with the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs in Parliament about the naturalisation of members of the Gupta family. “We could not predict in 2015 that some members of these families would be suspected of corruption. But even so we’d have to wait for a court process to be completed,” Gigaba said.
