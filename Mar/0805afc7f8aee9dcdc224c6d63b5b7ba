In a race to wrap up their work on the Eskom inquiry, the portfolio committee on public enterprises plans to hear from Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, the Gupta brothers and Duduzani Zuma all in one day. Before kicking off the inquiry on Wednesday, where former board chair Ben Ngubane is expected to testify, chair Zukiswa Rantho settled a few administrative issues. This includes the appearance of several others, including former SAA chair Dudu Myeni. Committee members accepted Gigaba’s request for an extension to appear before the committee. Gigaba has been granted 10 days to prepare, and will appear before the inquiry on Tuesday, March 13. As for the Gupta brothers Atul and Ajay, committee members were concerned that Atul who is a fugitive may not appear.
It is proposed that business associates Salim Essa and Eric Wood appear instead. The inquiry had eight months to do its work and a report of the findings was to be submitted to Parliament in March 2018. Committee members agreed that the inquiry should wrap up by the end of the month. – Fin24
