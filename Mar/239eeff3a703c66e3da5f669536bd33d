With less than a month to migrate core components of the grants scheme from Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and the South African post office are briefing the media on their progress. On Tuesday, the Constitutional Court heard that Sassa did not have alternative plans if the court refused to extend the CPS contract by another six months. The agency argued that about2.8-million beneficiaries would not get their grant payments if the contract with CPS, which expires on March 31, was not extended. Sassa said it was concerned about 29% of its grant beneficiaries who depend on cash deliveries of their social grants – a service that CPS currently provides.
