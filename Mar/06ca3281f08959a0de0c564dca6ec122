Manchester United have announced plans to form a women’s professional team after long being criticised for lagging behind their rivals. The Premier League giants are the only top-flight club in England without a senior women’s team. United said they had submitted an application to the Football Association to join the second tier of the Women’s Super League. “We are pleased to announce that the club intends to establish its first-ever professional women’s team and has submitted an application to enter the Women’s Super League 2,” said Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. “The Football Association has provided excellent support through the process and we believe that launching a team in the Women’s Super League 2 would give many more of our graduates from the regional talent club the chance to establish themselves as first-team players. “The Manchester United women’s team must be built in the same image and with the same principles as the men’s first team and offer academy players a clear route to top-level football within the club.” Former Red Devils player and current England women’s coach Phil Neville recently called on his former club to form a women’s team. In the House of Commons on Thursday the sports minister, Tracey Crouch, praised Manchester United for “finally dragging themselves into the 21st century”. Commons speaker John Bercow — an avid Gunners supporter — chimed in, saying that Manchester United are certainly “light years behind Arsenal”.
