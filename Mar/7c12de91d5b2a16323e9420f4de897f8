The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has urged the Department of Basic Education to ensure that food sold to pupils does not contain ingredients such as polony, after the announcement on Sunday of the source of the listeriosis outbreak. Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said the recent outbreak of the deadly Listeria bacteria had been traced to Enterprise’s Polokwane facility, which manufactures products such as polony.

The South African outbreak of listeriosis has claimed 180 lives and was successfully traced after several children presented with gastroenteritis.
