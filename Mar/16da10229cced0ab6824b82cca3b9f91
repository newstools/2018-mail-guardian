The National Energy Regulator (Nersa) has told Eskom it cannot pass cost increases on to consumers. Rather, it will be expected to cut operational costs and inefficiencies.

A World Bank study, referred to by Nersa, puts Eskom’s average annual staff cost per employee at $61 000 (R708 000) compared with $13 000 (R151 000) for employees in other sub-Saharan countries.
