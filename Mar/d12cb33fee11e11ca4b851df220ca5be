A new mobile app, “Gauteng on the Move”, that will provide commuters with real time public transit information, timetables and fares for different transport modes in the province was launched by the Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport on Thursday. A statement by the department says that commuters will be able to use the app to plan their journeys “with the option to select desired transport modes, travel times and criteria specific to travel modes (eg. shortest versus cheapest trip).” The transport modes covered by the app are Gautrain, Metrobus, A re Yeng,  Rea Vaya, Metrorail, Gautrain Bus Services, Johannesburg City Sightseeing Bus, Tshwane Bus Services as well as minibus taxi services. Speaking on the sidelines of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Mobility Seminar, Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport, Ismail Vadi said: “There’s no doubt that global technological changes are sparking a revolution in the transport sector, and we must adopt and adapt to these changes. “The ‘Gauteng on the Move’ App fits into the province’s modernisation agenda, providing commuters with real-time and point-to-point information when moving from a current to a desired location.” According to Vadi, the province will use innovation, research and development to promote efficiency and access to transport services. “This will be pursued through strategic investments in ICT infrastructure. The Gauteng provincial government has invested time, effort and resources into the development of this journey planner application that will allow commuters to seamlessly connect to major transport modes within the province,” he said. The app is not available for download yet.
