Tiger Brands has suspended production at its Pretoria plant following detection of “very low levels” of Listeria monocytogenes. The company said that the bacteria detected was within government standards, however, it had decided to take precautionary steps by closing the plant and recalling all ready-to-eat Snax products. It said in a press statement that given the closure of the Polokwane, Germiston and Pretoria sites, Tiger Brands would also begin to wind down operations at its Clayville abattoir, in Gauteng, with the hope of suspending operations by the end of March.

To date, the Germiston and Polokwane operations remain closed and all Enterprise ready-to-eat meat products are no longer available for sale.
