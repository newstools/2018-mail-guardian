A summons related to the arms deal corruption case has been served on former president Jacob Zuma, according to his lawyer Michael Hulley. Hulley confirmed that the summons had been served on Monday afternoon. “There was a summons served on my office today in respect to Mr Zuma,” he told the Mail & Guardian. It has taken 10 days for a summons to be served on Zuma after the National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams announced on March 16 that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) was reinstating corruption charges against Zuma. Abrahams said there are 16 charges standing from an 18-charge indictment that was withdrawn in 2009. The charges include one count of racketeering, two counts of corruption, one count of money-laundering and 12 counts of fraud. Zuma has always protested his innocence, even though his financial adviser, Schabir Shaik was imprisoned for bribing him. Zuma is now expected to appear in the Durban high court on April 6.
