Are you fed-up with being harassed by unsolicited phone calls and SMSes from marketers and even political parties? This might be coming to an end with the Protection of Personal Information Act (or Popi, as it is popularly known), which will make the dos and don’ts of direct marketing clear. Currently direct marketing is controlled by the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) of 2008 and the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act of 2002. With the new Act, marketers will be required to offer “opt out” consent for existing customers and “opt in” for new customers. This means new consumers can only be targeted by phone calls or text messaging if they have previously agreed to receive such communications.
