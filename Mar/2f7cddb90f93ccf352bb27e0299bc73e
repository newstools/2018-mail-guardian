Despite the great lengths Australian skipper  Steve Smith has gone to in an attempt to convince all and sundry that the ball-tampering scandal that rocked the third Test against the Proteas at Newlands was the first time under his captaincy that cheating has taken place, shocking new evidence has emerged suggesting Smith may be lying, or at best, blissfully unaware.

Television footage during Saturday’s Day 3 clearly showed Bancroft take an object out of his pocket during the post-lunch session and rub it on the ball.

But this appears not to be the first time Bancroft has been involved in a possible cheating scandal after footage emerged of him allegedly putting spoonfuls of sugar in his pocket during the recently concluded Ashes series. While it’s not illegal to put sugar in one’s trouser pocket, fans will no doubt make up their own minds as to why anyone would feel the need to do so, mindful of course that current Proteas skipper  Faf du Plessis was found guilty by the ICC of ball tampering against Australia in 2016 after rubbing a sugary lolly on the ball in Hobart. Smith was the skipper in the Ashes series in late 2017/early 2018, which Australia won 4-0. ― Sport24
