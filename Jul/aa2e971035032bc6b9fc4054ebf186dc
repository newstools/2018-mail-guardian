Both grades of petrol, 93 and 95 (ULP & LRP), will increase by 26 cents and 23 cents a litre respectively on Wednesday, the Department of Energy announced on Sunday. Diesel 0.05% sulphur and diesel 0.005% sulphur will increase by 26c and 24c a litre respectively. Illuminating paraffin (wholesale) will go up by 22c, while illuminating paraffin (SMNRP) will cost 30c more per litre. The maximum retail price for LPGAS will spike by 37c a per kilogram. The DoE ascribed the huge spike in fuel prices to a weaker rand. “The average rand/US dollar exchange rate for the period June 1, 2018 to June 28, 2018 was R13.2871 compared to R12.5099 during the previous period. “This led to a higher contribution to the Basic Fuel Prices on petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 43.21c/l, 44.36c/l and 44.62c/l respectively.” The latest hike has taken the per litre price of petrol further into record territory, with motorists now having to fork out R15.53 and R16.02 for a litre of 95 octane unleaded petrol on the coast and inland respectively. The Automobile Association said on Thursday South Africans have been thrown a lifeline by declining oil prices in June, but not enough to avert another hike in fuel prices. ― Fin24
