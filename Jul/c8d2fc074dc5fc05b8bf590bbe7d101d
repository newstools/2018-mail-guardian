The National Prosecuting Authority has confirmed that Duduzani Zuma has been summoned to court on two charges of culpable homicide. “He’ll appear in court on July 12 at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court,” said NPA spokesperson Phindi Louw. The charges relate to a car accident that occurred in February 2014 when Zuma lost control of his Porsche and rear-ended a taxi on the Grayston Drive off-ramp on the M1, north of Johannesburg’s city centre. Phumzile Dube was killed instantly while three others were injured. She was a mother to a two-year-old daughter at the time.
The family received R5 000 from the taxi association after her death and no compensation was paid from the Road Accident Fund. A second woman, Jeanette Mashaba, died a couple of weeks later. However, during the inquest, it was found that her death was not a result of the accident and that she died in hospital of natural causes. In July 2014, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) declined to prosecute Zuma, citing insufficient evidence. The NPA decided not to prosecute Zuma in August 2015 even though Magistrate Lalitha Chetty found prima facie evidence that his negligent actions had caused Dube’s death. Afrikaner rights group AfriForum gave the NPA an ultimatum at the end of last year to either prosecute Zuma or release a nolle prosequi certificate (required for a private prosecution), which would allow former NPA prosecutor Gerrie Nel, known as the “Pit Bull”, to prosecute him. NPA head Shaun Abrahams decided to prosecute the former president’s son for culpable homicide in April. — News 24
