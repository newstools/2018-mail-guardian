The Mail & Guardian, in partnership with the Adamela Trust, is pleased to invite programmers, developers and journalists with coding experience to apply for a one-year fellowship in its Johannesburg newsroom. The successful candidate will join the M&G’s newly formed data desk, which seeks to bring a new dimension to how stories are crafted and delivered to readers. The recruit’s focus will be on acquiring, cleaning and, together with the team leader, analysing datasets to identify the stories hidden in the numbers.

The ideal candidate will be able to write code and have a basic understanding of programming languages such as Python, SQL or R. The recruit is not required to have a journalism background, but it will count in their favour, and associated skills will be further honed by working with the award-winning journalists of the M&G.
