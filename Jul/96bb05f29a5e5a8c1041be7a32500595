The Curro group of private schools is facing backlash over fresh allegations of racism at its preschool in Waterfall, Gauteng. The school has denied the racism allegations, saying over the weekend that an independent investigation has cleared it of discrimination. But, the Waterfall preschool isnâ€™t the first school in the Curro group to be embroiled in a race row. In 2015, parents brought a Curro school in the Northern Cape to a standstill during a protest against alleged racism at the school.
Similar allegations have been made in Roodeplaat, where there were two separate investigations into racism within a span of just four months. While Curro has consistently denied that it endorses racist policies, it is still reckoning with a recent history of serious accusations of discrimination.
