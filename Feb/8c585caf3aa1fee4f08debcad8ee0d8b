Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as President of South Africa on Thursday afternoon, February 15. He assumed office after former president Jacob Zuma tendered his resignation in a 30-minute public address on Wednesday evening. The Democratic Alliance, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Congress of the People attempted to dissolve Parliament before Ramaphosa was inaugurated, but were unsuccessful. The EFF even walked out of Parliament a few minutes before the presidential nomination process started. However, DA leader Mmusi Maimane has promised to support Ramaphosa as long as he acts in the interest of the country. DA leader Mmusi Maimane at the podium: Congratulations to president #Ramaphosa. If you act in the interests of South Africa, we will assist you in that mission. — Govan Whittles (@van1go) February 15, 2018 This is a developing story
