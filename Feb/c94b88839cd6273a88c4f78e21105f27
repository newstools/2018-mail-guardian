The National Assembly has just voted in favour of beginning a process so that the Constitution can be amended to allow land expropriation without compensation. On Tuesday, 324 of 400 MPs sat in the National Assembly to vote on the motion that was brought by the Economic Freedom Fighters. 241 MPs voted in favour of the motion, while 83 voted against it. There were no abstentions. The EFF’s motion, which was led by Julius Malema, calls for the establishment of a parliamentary ad hoc committee that will review and amend section 25 of the Constitution after hearing public submissions from policy makers, academics, civil society and the public. The ANC, Inkatha Freedom Party, and the National Freedom Party voiced their support for the motion.

But the Democratic Alliance and the Freedom Front Plus voted against the motion.
The DA said that a proposal to expropriate land without compensation “undermines” property rights. Congress of the People leader Terror Lekota also ignited controversy in the House after saying that colonisers did not steal land from black people, because the Khoisan entered into an agreement with settlers for their land to be taken. Malema responded to Lekota, saying: “You are a historical mistake”.
