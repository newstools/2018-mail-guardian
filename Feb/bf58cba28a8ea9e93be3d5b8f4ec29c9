Minister of Police General Bheki Cele is waging war on fake Twitter accounts impersonating him. Minister Cele has also apparently adopted his previous title of general, which he held during his stint as the national police commissioner before he was axed by former president Jacob Zuma. Minister General Cele of “shoot-to-kill” policy and snazzy fedora fame issued a strong warning to nefarious fellows masquerading as him. In a media statement released on Wednesday, Minister General Cele expressed “utter disgust” and “disappointment”  at some of the posts disseminated from these accounts. He further noted the “dirty and tricky mud games” used by sinister forces to bring disrepute to his office would not be tolerated. “Social media remains a respectable communication platform that should be exempted from any abuse by ghost operators.” Despite the minister general’s tough stand on assailants, Cele ended his tongue lashing by expressing his gratitude for the sincere messages congratulating his appointment.
