The OR Tambo International Airport had to be evacuated on Monday after an unattended bag was found by officials. “What happened was there was an unattended bag found in a terminal building and [the matter] is now being handled by the SA Police,” airport spokesperson Leigh Gunkel-Keuler told News24. She said the scene was evacuated out of precaution. One traveller, Abraham Krüger, told the
M&G that there was major confusion at the airport on Monday, as police “chased” people out of the airport. Krüger said that travellers were not given any information about what was happening, although those in the airport lounges were briefed 20 minutes before they were meant to evacuate. Individuals have subsequently been allowed to check in, but there are major queues of travellers hoping to check in. More to follow. —
