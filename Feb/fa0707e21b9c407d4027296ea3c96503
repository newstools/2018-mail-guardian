National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams has made his decision on whether or not former president Jacob Zuma should face prosecution for corruption. The City Press reported over the weekend that Zuma is set to face 18 charges.
Prosecutors inside the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had decided to reinstate charges against Zuma, the newspaper said, and had delivered a signed memorandum to Abrahams recommending that Zuma be prosecuted. Abrahams received recommendations on Friday from the prosecutions team. According to the City Press article, he will face 18 charges that are linked to 783 payments he allegedly received during the arms deal saga.

Abrahams has yet to make an announcement on the decision, eNCA said, because of an ongoing legal battle around his appointment as the NDPP. The Constitutional Court will on Wednesday hear Abrahams’ appeal against the Pretoria high court judgment, which ordered his appointment to be set aside after it was found that his predecessor Mxolisi Nxasana was unlawfully axed by Zuma when he was still president.
